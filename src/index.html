      The basic goal of the Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) language is to allow a browser engine to paint elements of the page with specific features, like colors, positioning, or decorations. The CSS syntax reflects this goal and its basic building blocks are:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>property</strong> which is an identifier, that is a human-readable name, that defines which feature is considered.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>value</strong> which describe how the feature must be handled by the engine. Each property has a set of valid values, defined by a formal grammar, as well as a semantic meaning, implemented by the browser engine.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section id='css_declarations' class="main-section">
    <header class='section-header'>
      <h2>CSS Declarations</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>
      Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. A property and value pair is called a declaration, and any CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out, and to style it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both properties and values are case-insensitive by default in CSS. The pair is separated by a colon,<code>':'</code>, and white spaces before, between, and after properties and values, but not necessarily inside, are ignored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are more than <strong>100 different properties</strong> in CSS and a nearly infinite number of different values. Not all pairs of properties and values are allowed and each property defines what are the valid values. When a value is not valid for a given property, the declaration is deemed invalid and is wholly ignored by the CSS engine.
    </p>

    <header class='section-header'>
      <h2>CSS Declaration Blocks</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>
      Declarations are grouped in blocks, that is in a structure delimited by an opening brace, <code>{</code> and a closing one, <code>}</code>. Blocks sometimes can be nested, so opening and closing braces must be matched.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Such blocks are naturally called declaration blocks and declarations inside them are separated by a semi-colon,<code>;</code>. A declaration block may be empty, that is containing null declaration. White spaces around declarations are ignored. The last declaration of a block doesn't need to be terminated by a semi-colon, though it is often considered good style to do it as it prevents forgetting to add it when extending the block with another declaration.
    </p>

  <section id='css_rulesets' class="main-section">
    <header class='section-header'>
      <h2>CSS Rulesets</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>
      If style sheets could only apply a declaration to each element of a Web page, they would be pretty useless. The real goal is to apply different declarations to different parts of the document.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      CSS allows this by associating conditions with declarations blocks. Each (valid) declaration block is preceded by one or more comma-separated selectors, which are conditions selecting some elements of the page. A selector group and an associated declarations block, together, are called a ruleset, or often simply a rule.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As an element of the page may be matched by several selectors, and therefore by several rules potentially containing a given property several times, with different values, the CSS standard defines which one has precedence over the other and must be applied: this is called the cascade algorithm.
    </p>

  <section id='css_statements' class="main-section">
    <header class='section-header'>
      <h2>CSS Statements</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>
     Rulesets are the main building blocks of a style sheet, which often consists of only a big list of them. But there is other information that a Web author wants to convey in the style sheet, like the character set, other external style sheets to import, font face or list counter descriptions and many more. It will use other and specific kinds of statements to do that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A statement is a building block that begins with any non-space characters and ends at the first closing brace or semi-colon (outside a string, non-escaped and not included into another {}, () or [] pair).
    </p>
    
    <p>
     There are two kinds of statements:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Rulesets</strong> (or rules) that, as seen, associate a collection of CSS declarations to a condition described by a selector.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>At-rules</strong> that start with an at sign, <code>@</code>, followed by an identifier and then continuing up the end of the statement, that is up to the next semi-colon (;) outside of a block, or the end of the next block. Each type of at-rules, defined by the identifier, may have its own internal syntax, and semantics of course. They are used to convey meta-data information (like @charset or @import), conditional information (like @media or @document), or descriptive information (like @font-face).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any statement which isn't a ruleset or an at-rule is invalid and ignored.</p>
